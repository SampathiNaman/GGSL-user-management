## **Assumptions and Considerations**

### **Assumptions**
- **API Stability:** The Reqres API endpoints will remain stable and accessible throughout the project development and usage. No changes to the API structure or response format are expected.
- **Browser Compatibility:** The app will support modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. Older browsers (e.g., Internet Explorer) may not be fully compatible.
- **User Interface:** The design will follow basic UI principles, ensuring responsiveness and accessibility, but will not be highly customized or intricate in style.

### **Considerations**
- **Error Handling:** Proper error handling will be implemented to manage issues such as failed network requests, invalid inputs, and API errors. This includes showing user-friendly error messages.
- **Performance:** As the list of users grows, pagination will be crucial for maintaining performance. Lazy loading of users may be considered for optimizing data fetching.
- **Security:** Sensitive data such as user credentials should be handled securely. Although the Reqres API may not require strict security features, additional security measures (e.g., HTTPS, input sanitization) should be implemented in production environments.
- **Accessibility:** The app will be built with accessibility in mind, ensuring keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and color contrast for users with disabilities.
- **State Management:** For more complex user data interactions, state management libraries like Redux could be considered in the future, especially if the app expands to handle more dynamic user interactions.
